# Introduction
The World Bank holds huge amount of data and categorized them to various indicators from 22 topics including Education, Health, Environment, Energy etc. This data that has been collected from the past few decades from various recognized international resources is kept open for public so that it can be used for various analysis and projects. This report contains the analysis on how energy usage using non-renewable energy sources and its consumption from sectors such as industries, commercial, non-commercial etc. is impacting the environment and health.

The fossil fuels include most of the non-renewable energy resources such as Coal, Petroleum products,  Nuclear energy etc. which are used for electricity generation, Transport, plastic products etc. These industries, vehicles and factories that generates electricity releases tremedous amounts of pollutants such as CO2, NO2	 etc. in to air and water causing severe damage to the environment. This will cause severe damage to the all life forms and is not limited to humans. The diseases that are primarliy linked to airpollution includes, strokes, CVD, Cancers and chronic respiratory infections. The analysis from the data of the three key economic powers of Asia, Europe and North america will helps us understand the change, impacts and other factors contributing to the scenario.

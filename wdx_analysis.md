# Introduction
The World Bank holds huge amount of data and categorized them to various indicators from 22 topics including Education, Health, Environment, Energy etc. This data that has been collected from the past few decades from various recognized international resources is kept open for public so that it can be used for various analysis and projects. This report contains the analysis on how energy usage using non-renewable energy sources and its consumption from sectors such as industries, commercial, non-commercial etc. is impacting the environment and health.

The fossil fuels include most of the non-renewable energy resources such as Coal, Petroleum products,  Nuclear energy etc. which are used for electricity generation, Transport, plastic products etc. These industries, vehicles and factories that generates electricity releases tremedous amounts of pollutants such as CO2, NO2	 etc. in to air and water causing severe damage to the environment. This will cause severe damage to the all life forms and is not limited to humans. The diseases that are primarliy linked to airpollution includes, strokes, CVD, Cancers and chronic respiratory infections. The analysis from the data of the three key economic powers of Asia, Europe and North america will helps us understand the change, impacts and other factors contributing to the scenario.

From the above graph we can see that, the consumption of the fossil fuels (%) in the united states is gradually decreasing.

It is clear that, germany has been reducing its fossil fuel dependency for energy from the past decade

The above line plot of the fossil fuel consumption percentage of asian country Japan is on contrast to its north american and european counter parts, where there is high usage of fossil fuels for energy purpose

It is obvious to think that, CO2 emission percentage will increase with increase in fossil fuel consumption but from the above line plot above, we can observe that in United states, although the dependency on the fossil fuel is gradually decreasing, there is increase in CO2 emissions for the each respective year. So it is clear, that fossil fuel is not the only contributer of the CO2 gas emission. Let us look at further analysis on this

From the further analysis on the mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes and CRD for the 3 countries, we can notice that, since the emission of CO2 in germany is reduced from 2010 there is a noticeable decrease in mortality rate of the diseases caused due to environmental damage. For the countries, United states and Japan where the CO2 emissions are increasing gradually, the mortality rate of the diseases was decreased very slightly. So, CO2 emissions quanity is not only the primary factor that needs to be considered for analyzing the impact on health. Therefore, the other pollutant quantities also needs to be analyzed for the deep research

# Report on impact of Energy usage & consumption on Environment and Health
The World Bank holds huge amount of data and categorized them to various indicators from 22 topics including Education, Health, Environment, Energy etc. This data that has been collected from the past few decades from various recognized international resources is kept open for public so that it can be used for various analysis and projects. This report contains the analysis on how energy usage using non-renewable energy sources and its consumption from sectors such as industries, commercial, non-commercial etc. is impacting the environment and health.

The fossil fuels include most of the non-renewable energy resources such as Coal, Petroleum products,  Nuclear energy etc. which are used for electricity generation, Transport, plastic products etc. These industries, vehicles and factories that generates electricity releases tremedous amounts of pollutants such as CO2, NO2	 etc. in to air and water causing severe damage to the environment. This will cause severe damage to the all life forms and is not limited to humans. The diseases that are primarliy linked to airpollution includes, strokes, CVD, Cancers and chronic respiratory infections. The analysis from the data of the three key economic powers of Asia, Europe and North america will helps us understand the change, impacts and other factors contributing to the scenario. The comparison of fossil fuel consumption needs to be done between the 3 countries USA, Germany and Japan. For further analysis, the CO2 emission quantities of these countries will help us understand if that is the primary factor of the impact on health and there is a relation between the two. If not there is a need to look at other contributers for the analysis and research on the hypothesis.

From the above graph we can see that, the consumption of the fossil fuels (%) in the united states is gradually decreasing. It is clear that, germany has been reducing its fossil fuel dependency for energy from the 2005 to 2015. The fossil fuel consumption percentage of asian country Japan, shows decreased use from 2005 to 2010, has abruplty increased its fossil fuel consumption from 2010 to 2015.

It is obvious to think that, CO2 emission percentage will increase with increase in fossil fuel consumption but from the above line plot above, we can observe that in United states and Japan, there is increase in CO2 emissions from 2005 to 2015. In contrast, Germany showed reduction in  CO2 emissions from the year 2010. So it is clear that, the government policies on the environment protection is a factor that needs to be considered. Let us look at further analysis on this

From the further analysis on the mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes and CRD for the 3 countries, we can notice from the line plot that, although the mortality rate for the diseases in all the 3 countries showed decreasing but America holds highest number in 2015, followed by germany and Japan. This reduction in mortality rate is encouraging but the improvement in health care sector, awareness towards government policies, literacy rate, science and technology improvements from 2005 to 2015 might be the primary cause.

From the year 2005 to 2010 the germany had the highest CO2 emissions and Japan had the lowest but United states had the highest fuel consumptuon percentage.

In the year 2010, United states CO2 emission percentage increased to that of germany. Furthermore, the Japan's CO2 content in the atmosphjere is also increased.

By the year 2015, the fuel dependency is increased in the japan, showing similar change in the CO2 emissions and mortality rate percentage of diseases from air pollutants.
